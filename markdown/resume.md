Technologies and Skills
--------------------

### Programming Languages & Software Tools

:   **Python:** Using [Python](https://python.org), I've developed a number of simple scripts
                and programs to complete assignments and automate common workflows in my 
                everyday life. For example, in order to streamline data entry, I developed a script that
                copies text pulled from a PDF and can be configured to paste it into a browser form, 
                and then submit that form. I also have experience writing modules, and am currently working
                on writing a small testing suite. Python is also my language of choice when solving algorithm
                problems due to its ease of use and readability.

:   **Go:** With [Go](https://go.dev), I've developed a number of single-page applications, HTTP services,
            and have studied how microservices and cloud services are written using the language. Though Python
            is more widely used and is often more convenient, I find that Go's modular structure, vast but deep
            standard library fast runtimes, and memorable syntax is a perfect fit for me. My current development 
            project is a Go module that will streamline the creation of assertion functions when writing unit tests.

:   **Javascript:** I've used the React and Vue frameworks in both personal and collegiate projects. The initial
                    version of my portfolio site was written in React, with the current version written in Vue.
                    I am also comfortable with the Node.js framework when writing backends, having direct
                    experience writing local databases using Node and PostgreSQL

:   Foundational knowledge of  **Java**, **Google Cloud Platform**, **Git**, **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**

### Soft Skills

:   **Teamwork & Communication:** Having worked 5+ years in sales and service roles, I understand the value of having a reliable
                                  team. I'm an effective communicator, and my strongest belief is that a friendly disposition and 
                                  appropriate sense of humor can bring any group of people together and create a positive work environment.

:   **Leadership:** My experience running shifts in a service environment and leading an API integration
                    project in an office environment means I understand how to take charge in a way that feels
                    inclusive and welcoming, yet serves its purpose in with flying colors.
